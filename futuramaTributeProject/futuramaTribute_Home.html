                          The MCU's Phase Three premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16. A number of critics praised the film's direction, screenplay, acting (particularly Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, while others criticized the computer-generated visual effects. Its cultural significance was also noted by many critics as one of the best films in the MCU. As one of the top ten films of 2018, Black Panther was named by organizations such as the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute. With over $1.3 billion in worldwide sales, it became the highest-grossing film directed by a Black filmmaker, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.

This story resembles a throne fight between two brothers on the surface, but on the inside it is much more.A masterpiece and the best African superhero ever created by Ryan Coogler. In this film, Chadwick Boseman and other actors displayed amazing talent, demonstrating the potential of black people. No other director, in my opinion, has a vision as clear as Ryan Coogler's when it comes to the cultural setting of Wakanda and all of its values. This film's special effects and visual effects are also amazing.</td>

              <td>  The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.
     
                The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T’Challa’s from prince to king coronation process.

              After we get a real introduction to our key villain (Michael B. Jordan) that we really get down to business. The movie asks knotty questions about reaching out to help those like you who have been persecuted, even if you yourself have escaped the world’s subjugation and thrived by virtue of your invisibility. In a time of great social and political upheaval, the question of how much allies should be expected to sacrifice even if the rot hasn’t personally affected them yet may be the defining moral question of our time.
         
                  The film keeps its righteous anger mostly in the hands of its villain, and it works as a rousing superhero adventure for kids who want to see a black superhero doing the superhero thing. But it is still refreshing to see a Walt Disney superhero movie taking for granted that America is intrinsically detrimental to black lives.

            Black Panther is a fine stand-alone action drama that deals with the consequences of a modern civilization made possible by widespread colonization.
     
            The cinematography also very neat and the visuals were stunning. The ancestral plane sequences were top notch. The first fight between Tchalla and kill monger is well choreographed the end fight is full of CGI. The production design and costumes perfectly suited the African nation. The musical score is one of the biggest elements in this film. Salutes to Ryan coogler for this Marvelous movie.

            The notable elements for me are excellent acting all around, strong female characters, relevancy to the real world, humor, and amazing visuals. Normally, I find action-packed scenes to be dull, but the ones in this movie had me transfixed to the screen. This movie fully merits the high praise it has received from critics. Much more than just a superhero movie, it is. I can now see why Chadwick Boseman's passing was so widely lamented. How he managed to film this while battling cancer is beyond amazing. Knowing the state of his health and whether he was aware of the kind of legacy he would leave behind, I can only speculate as to what was even going through his head. Anyway, I can't stress how much I love this movie!
